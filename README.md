# rss.sh

A small shell script for downloading rss feed to you're computer,
meant as a simpler alternative to rss readers like newsboat.

This script does not contain a way to view your feed, and is meant
as a backend for other viewers to be built on. You can even write
your own small viewer using `dmenu`, `rofi` or maybe just `fzf` like
[I have done](https://github.com/Hejsil/dotfiles/blob/master/.local/script/rss-read.sh).
